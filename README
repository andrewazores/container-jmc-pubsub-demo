== SEE ALSO
This repository is meant as a supplemental demo for the JMXClient at
https://github.com/andrewazores/container-jmc .

== REQUIREMENTS
JDK
Podman/Docker
Gradle

== BUILD
Use the included `build.sh` script, which will invoke `./gradlew build` to
compile the project sources as well as the appropriate container management
command to build an image.

== RUN
For convenience, `sh run.sh` can be used to run a demo. This will run two
containers with images containing the Publisher and Subscriber classes and the
RJMX ports exposed. The Subscriber image simply listens on its localhost port
9090 and periodically writes lines it receives to its stdout stream. The
Publisher connects to the Subscriber on port 9090 and writes randomly generated
numbers at random intervals. A Client container will also be run alongside the
Publisher and Subscriber.

Within the Docker bridged network the Publisher can be identified via its
hostname of "jmx-publisher". Likewise, the Subscriber can be identified with
"jmx-subscriber".

If you run run.sh with no arguments then the Client container is started in an
interactive shell-like mode. If you run it with arguments then the arguments
are treated as a series of shell-like commands delimited with semicolons,
equivalent to typing the commands into the shell in interactive mode.

=== EXAMPLES

`sh build.sh && sh run.sh`
This will set up the demo Publisher, Subscriber, and Client and drop you into
the Client "shell". Try "help" to see a listing of available commands.

There is a demo "script" located in the "demos" directory. This can be used as
follows: `sh run.sh "$(more demos/pubsub)"`.
